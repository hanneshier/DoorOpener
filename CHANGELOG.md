## v[1.14.0] - 2026-06-30

### 🔐 Security & Hardening
- **Pinned to a single Gunicorn worker** — `Dockerfile` changed from `--workers 2 --threads 2` to `--workers 1 --threads 4`. The brute-force/rate-limit counters live in process memory, so running multiple workers multiplied the effective allowed attempts (and the global hourly cap). Concurrency is preserved via threads. A comment in the `Dockerfile` documents why this must stay at one worker.
- **Bounded rate-limit memory growth** — added a self-throttled `_cleanup_rate_limit_state()` (runs at most once every 5 minutes from the `before_request` hook). Last-seen times are recorded in `get_client_identifier`, and the sweep evicts idle IP/session/identifier keys from the rate-limit `defaultdict`s, drops expired block timestamps, and prunes the problem-report window. These structures previously only ever grew — a slow memory-exhaustion vector under long uptime or IP/session rotation.

### ⚡ Performance
- **Battery reads are cached server-side** — `/battery` is wrapped in a 30s TTL cache (`_fetch_battery_level()` does the actual upstream read). The keypad page polls every 60s per open client; the cache collapses N concurrent clients into at most one Home Assistant read per window.
- **Battery polling pauses when the tab is hidden** — polling now starts/stops on `visibilitychange`, so a backgrounded keypad stops hitting the server (and HA); it resumes with an immediate fetch when the tab is shown again.

### 🛠️ Technical
- **`open_door` deduplicated (~250 fewer lines)** — extracted `log_attempt()`, `_ha_service_url()`, `_enforce_active_block()`, and `_send_open_command()`. The two near-identical ~75-line HA-call blocks (OIDC + PIN) collapsed into one helper, the two block-enforcement blocks into one, and ~20 inline log dicts into `log_attempt()` calls. Side benefit: OIDC test-mode opens now also call `touch_user`, consistent with the PIN path.
- **Consolidated logging setup** — `logging.basicConfig` now runs once up front (console + `door_access.log`), the application `logger` is assigned a single time (no more triple reassignment / `__name__` shadowing), and the audit logger keeps its dedicated `log.txt` handler.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **`.env.example` default port** — corrected from `5000` to `6532` to match the rest of the app.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added a regression test asserting two `/battery` requests within the TTL trigger only one upstream call; the battery cache is reset per-test in `conftest.py`.

## v[1.13.1] - 2026-04-09

### ✨ Features
- **Test mode toggle in admin panel** — enable/disable test mode live from the admin dashboard without editing `config.ini`; change is persisted to config and takes effect immediately
- **Test mode banner on keypad page** — when test mode is active a visible amber banner ("🧪 TEST MODE — door will not open") appears above the keypad so users know the door is inactive

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Admin page JS crash on unauthenticated load** — dashboard event listeners ran unconditionally at page load, throwing `Cannot read properties of null` when the dashboard elements weren't rendered (unauthenticated session); listeners are now guarded behind element existence checks
- **`docker-compose.yml`: `config.ini` mounted read-only** — the test mode toggle (and any other admin-panel config writes) silently failed because `config.ini` was mounted `:ro`; changed to `:rw`

### 🎨 UI/UX
- **CSP compliance: removed all inline `style=` attributes from templates** — pin-dot animation delays moved to CSS `nth-child` rules; report modal icon extracted to a CSS class; eliminates a flood of CSP `style-src` violations in the browser console

---

## v[1.13.0] - 2026-04-09

### 🔐 Security
- **Fix: CSRF token missing for OIDC admin logins** — admins authenticating via SSO were never issued an `admin_csrf_token`, causing all subsequent CSRF-protected admin endpoints to fail or be bypassable
- **Dashboard HTML now gated server-side** — the full admin UI (forms, API endpoint names, JS) is only rendered in the HTTP response when the session is authenticated; unauthenticated requests receive the login form only
- **Fix: unauthenticated `GET /admin/background`** — endpoint now requires admin auth
- **IP-based rate limiting on `/admin/auth`** — the previous session-only limit (3 attempts) could be bypassed by opening multiple browser sessions; failures now also increment a per-IP counter so multi-session brute force is blocked
- **Replaced `imghdr` with `filetype`** — `imghdr` was removed from the Python stdlib in 3.13 and is unmaintained; `filetype` uses proper magic-byte detection
- **Removed obsolete `X-XSS-Protection` header** — superseded by CSP in all modern browsers; the header was a no-op and removed to reduce noise
- **`test_mode` warnings** — a `WARNING` is now logged at startup and a banner is shown in the admin panel when `test_mode = true` is set, making it harder to accidentally leave enabled in production
- **`FLASK_DEBUG` warning** — enabling the Werkzeug interactive debugger now logs a prominent warning noting the RCE risk

### ✨ Features
- **Public notice** — admins can post a short message (e.g. "Door out of service") that appears as a banner above the keypad; managed from the admin panel without a restart
- **Custom background image** — upload a JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP background from the admin panel (max 10 MB); the original default is preserved and can be restored at any time
- **Pushbullet problem reporting** — when a `[pushbullet] api_token` is configured, a report button appears on the keypad; users can send short messages to the admin, rate-limited to 3 per IP per hour
- **Optional page title** — set `[server] page_title` in `config.ini` to display a building/site name above the keypad

### 🎨 UI/UX
- Terminal-style "ACCESS GRANTED" animation on successful door open
- "Access denied" popup with scan line animation and ambient glow
- Page-bounce body animation when the Easter egg is triggered
- Toast notifications for door access errors
- Gear icon navigation button on the admin dashboard
- GitHub link button in the admin panel footer
- Admin panel layout refactored for better responsiveness across notice, background, stats, and leaderboard sections

### ⚙️ CI & Infrastructure
- CodeQL SARIF upload action bumped to v4
- Removed Sysdig scan workflow
- Dockerfile base updated to Python 3.12

### 📦 Dependencies
- `requests` 2.32.5 → 2.33.0
- `authlib` 1.6.7 → 1.6.9
- `filetype 1.2.0` added (replaces `imghdr`)

---

## v[1.11.0] - 2026-03-08

### 🎨 UI/UX
- **Dark mode** — full automatic dark theme via `prefers-color-scheme: dark`, covering keypad, battery widget, admin gear, PIN display, and all interactive states
- **Battery widget overhaul** — fill bar now correctly clips to the reported percentage using `overflow: hidden` + child `width: %`; null and out-of-range values render as 0% with a grey fill instead of broken display; widget auto-polls every 60 seconds without page reload
- **Keypad disabled state** — buttons grey out (`opacity: 0.35`, `pointer-events: none`) and become non-interactive for the full duration of a brute-force block countdown
- **GPU-accelerated popup animation** — access-granted/denied popups now animate with `transform: translateY()` instead of `top`, eliminating layout reflow on every frame
- **PIN placeholder** — "Enter PIN" placeholder no longer inherits `letter-spacing: 8px`; spacing is applied only to entered dot characters

### 🛠️ Technical
- **Atomic user store writes** — `users.json` is written via `tempfile.mkstemp` + `os.replace`, preventing file corruption if the process crashes mid-write
- **CSS consolidation** — merged two duplicate `.container` blocks and two duplicate `@media (max-width: 480px)` blocks; all inline styles moved to named CSS classes
- **Popup deduplication** — `showAccessDeniedPopup` and `showAccessGrantedPopup` unified into a single `showAccessPopup(id)` helper

### 🧪 Tests
- 13 new tests covering previously uncovered paths:
  - `/admin/check-auth` (authenticated and unauthenticated)
  - `/admin/logs/clear` (all modes, missing file, invalid mode, unauthenticated)
  - PIN length boundaries (too short, too long, empty, non-JSON body)
  - `UsersStore.effective_pins` with inactive users and invalid PINs in the store

### ⚙️ CI
- Python matrix expanded to **3.10 + 3.12**
- Pip caching added to all jobs
- `bandit` now fails the build on medium+ severity findings (removed `|| true`)
- `ruff` lint job no longer uses `continue-on-error`; `ruff format --check` step added
- Docker login switched from `GHCR_PAT` secret to `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no secret management needed)
- All actions pinned to `@v4` / `setup-python@v5`
- Redundant `pycodestyle` workflow removed (superseded by ruff)

---

## v[1.10.1] - 2025-12-09

### 🎨 UI/UX
- Added a fully responsive mobile view for the Users admin tab.
  - Users are rendered as touch-friendly cards on small screens with status badges and action buttons.
  - The desktop table remains unchanged; mobile now switches to cards for readability.

### 🐞 Fixes
- Corrected CSS so only the logs table is hidden on phones (users table/cards remain visible).
- Minor README cleanup (removed outdated notice).

---

## v[1.10.0] - 2025-09-16


> **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE**: Starting with v1.10.0, user management has been completely redesigned with a new JSON-based user store. **Existing users in `config.ini` [pins] section need to be migrated!**

## 🔄 **Migration Required**

**If you have users configured in `config.ini` [pins] section:**

1. **Update to v1.10.0** (your existing users will continue to work temporarily)
2. **Access Admin Panel** → Navigate to `http://your-dooropener:5000/admin`
3. **Go to Users Tab** → Click on the "Users" tab in the admin interface
4. **Click "Migrate All"** → This will move all your config.ini users to the new JSON store
5. **Verify Migration** → Check that all users appear in the Users tab with "store" source

**Benefits of Migration:**
- ✅ Edit user PINs without restarting the container
- ✅ Activate/deactivate users instantly
- ✅ Track usage statistics ("Times Used" counter)
- ✅ Full user management via web interface
- ✅ No more manual config.ini editing

**⚠️ Important:** The `config.ini` [pins] section will be **deprecated** in a future version. Migrate now to avoid disruption!

---

## 🔧 **Migration Guide for v1.10.0**

**If you're upgrading from a previous version, follow these steps:**

### 1. **Update Docker Compose**

Add the new `users.json` volume bind and make `config.ini` read-write:

```yaml
services:
  dooropener:
    image: ghcr.io/sloth-on-meth/dooropener:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config.ini:/app/config.ini:rw  # ⚠️ Changed from :ro to :rw
      - ./users.json:/app/users.json    # 🆕 New volume for user data
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    # ... rest of your config
```

### 2. **Start Container & Migrate Users**

**Note:** The app will automatically create `users.json` when needed - no manual file creation required!

```bash
# Start the updated container
docker-compose up -d

# Access admin panel 
# Go to Users tab → Click "Migrate All" button
```

### 3. **Verify Migration**

- Check that all users appear in the Users tab with "store" source
- Test that PINs still work
- Your `config.ini` [pins] section will be automatically cleaned up

**Why these changes?**
- `config.ini:rw` - Allows automatic removal of migrated users from config
- `users.json` - New persistent storage for user data with advanced features

---

### 👥 User Management & Migration System
- **NEW**: Complete admin UI for user management with tabbed interface (Logs/Users)
- **NEW**: JSON-based user store (`users.json`) with atomic operations and host persistence
- **NEW**: "Migrate All" functionality to bulk migrate config-only users from `config.ini` to JSON store
- **NEW**: Full CRUD operations for JSON store users (Create, Edit, Delete, Activate/Deactivate)
- **NEW**: Toast notifications throughout admin UI replacing blocking alert dialogs
- **NEW**: Log management with "Clear All Logs" functionality
- **NEW**: Button busy states with inline progress indicators for long-running operations
- **NEW**: Usage tracking - "Times Used" counter for each user showing door access frequency
- **IMPROVED**: User PIN resolution now prioritizes JSON store over config.ini entries
- **IMPROVED**: Migration process removes users from config.ini after successful JSON store creation
- **IMPROVED**: Admin UI uses modern modals and responsive design patterns
- **IMPROVED**: "Migrate All" button intelligently shows/hides based on available config-only users
- **BREAKING**: Individual user migration removed - use "Migrate All" for bulk operations
- **DEPRECATION**: config.ini [pins] section will be removed in a future version - migrate to JSON store

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Added `users.json` volume bind in docker-compose.yml for data persistence
- Simplified config.ini writing to avoid temporary file permission issues
- Enhanced error handling and logging for user management operations
- Added `user_exists()` method to UsersStore class
- Improved admin session authentication across all user management endpoints
- Added `times_used` counter that increments on successful door access
- Enhanced `touch_user()` method with usage tracking and backward compatibility

### 📝 Migration Instructions
- Existing config.ini [pins] users can be migrated via Admin → Users → "Migrate All"
- Migration preserves existing PINs and removes entries from config.ini
- JSON store users gain full management capabilities (edit PIN, activate/deactivate)
- Usage statistics are automatically tracked for all JSON store users
- No downtime required - config and JSON users work simultaneously during transition

## v[1.9.0] - 2025-09-16

### 🔐 TLS & Self‑Signed Certificates
- Added support for trusting a custom CA bundle for Home Assistant HTTPS requests.
- New `[HomeAssistant] ca_bundle` option in `config.ini` allows pointing to a PEM bundle.
- When set and readable, all HA `requests.get/post` calls use `verify=<ca_bundle>`.
- When not set, default system trust store is used (`verify=True`).
- README updated with Docker compose mount examples and env var alternatives (`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`).

### 🛡️ Security Headers
- Introduced per‑request CSP nonce and applied it to inline scripts in `templates/index.html` and `templates/admin.html`.
- CSP tightened to rely on nonces for scripts, with a safe fallback when nonce generation fails.

### 🔑 OIDC Logout Behavior
- Restored 500 responses when the OIDC well‑known or `end_session_endpoint` is missing to align with tests/expectations.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added SSL tests to ensure `verify=True` by default (no ca_bundle) and `verify=<path>` when a bundle is configured for both GET and POST HA calls.
- Adjusted admin auth tests to accept non‑blocking delay responses (HTTP 429) for progressive delays before blocking.

### 📝 CI & Linting
- pycodestyle step is now non‑blocking in CI (`continue-on-error: true`), emitting warnings instead of failing the job.
- Fixed PEP 8 style (E203/E302) and Ruff issues (`Response` typing, removed unused import).

### 📦 Version
- Bumped version to 1.9.0.

## v[1.8.0] - 2025-09-11

### 🚀 PWA & Installability
- Added Web App Manifest and Service Worker to enable install on mobile/desktop.
- Register Service Worker on load; added in-app "Install App" button (Android/Chrome).
- Manifest and icons wired; Apple touch icon supported via existing favicon.

### 🎛️ Keypad & UX
- Auto-submit is now debounced: users can type 4–8 digits; submit fires after a short pause.
- Keyboard auto-repeat is ignored to prevent floods from held keys.
- Submission lock prevents concurrent requests.
- "ACCESS GRANTED / DENIED" popups now appear above the glass card.

### 🔒 Security & Blocking
- Enforce active blocks even when a correct PIN or valid OIDC session is used.
- Persist session block across workers via signed cookie (`blocked_until_ts`).
- All block responses now include `blocked_until` (epoch seconds) for client countdowns.
- Frontend shows a live countdown toast until the block expires.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added tests verifying:
  - Correct PIN during active block still returns 429 and includes `blocked_until`.
  - Persisted session block denies OIDC pinless open and includes `blocked_until`.

### 🛠️ CI & Linting
- Removed Black from CI to avoid repo-vs-image formatting differences.
- `lint` job now runs Ruff only; separate pycodestyle workflow runs style checks without formatting.

### 📦 Version
- Bumped version to 1.8.0.

---

## v[1.7.0] - 2025-09-08

### 🔒 Security Enhancements (OIDC & App)
- OIDC now fully gated: all OIDC functionality is disabled unless the OAuth client is initialized and `enabled=true` in `[oidc]`.
- Added CSRF protection via `state` and replay protection via `nonce` in the OIDC flow.
- Enabled PKCE (`S256`).
- Strict token validation: issuer (`iss`) check, audience (`aud`) supports list or string, expiration (`exp`) and not‑before (`nbf`) with 60s leeway.
- Session fixation protection: session is cleared after successful token validation before setting auth data.
- Pinless open only when: OIDC enabled, session valid (non‑expired), user in allowed group (if configured), and `require_pin_for_oidc=false`.
- Hardened security headers: strong CSP, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`, `Permissions-Policy`, strict referrer policy, and no‑cache on dynamic endpoints.
- Admin login protected with progressive delays and temporary session blocking; all attempts are now audit‑logged.

### 🧪 Tests & CI
- Expanded OIDC tests: state/nonce, expired session behavior, pinless success, invalid state rejection, login redirect behavior, and OIDC gating.
- CI pushes Docker image to GHCR on every push using `docker/login-action` with PAT or `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback.

### 🐳 Docker & Runtime
- Adopted linuxserver.io‑style `PUID`/`PGID`/`UMASK` pattern for painless host permissions.
- New `entrypoint.sh` aligns runtime user/group to host IDs, ensures `/app/logs` is writable, applies umask, then drops privileges via `gosu`.
- Fixed Debian package availability in `python:3.9-slim` (trixie) by installing `passwd` (provides `useradd`/`groupadd`) instead of `shadow`.
- `docker-compose.yml` updated to include `PUID`, `PGID`, `UMASK` envs; `config.ini` stays read‑only; `logs/` is writeable.

### 📝 Logging & Observability
- Switched to `RotatingFileHandler` for both access and audit logs to prevent unbounded growth.
- All logs centralized under `/app/logs/` (mount `./logs:/app/logs`).

### 🎨 UI/UX
- Frontend SSO button visibility now strictly follows backend `oidc_enabled` flag.
- Added missing `openDoorWithSSO()` function to make SSO button functional.

### 📚 Documentation
- README refreshed with compose example, `PUID/PGID/UMASK`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, and logging paths in linuxserver.io style.
- `.env.example` updated with new envs.
- `config.ini.example` gains optional `[oidc] public_key` for local token signature validation.

### 🙏 Acknowledgements
- Thanks to @hanneshier for the idea and contributions around the OIDC flow.
- Thanks to @remijn for fixing my docker build flow
